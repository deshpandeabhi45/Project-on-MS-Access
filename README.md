In this project, the main purpose was to create a database by first creating an entity-relation model and then using the model to build the database into MS Access. In next step, designing multiple queries (including embedded queries) is done to obtain the required data. Using Visual Basic, windows forms are created. For web forms, HTML was used. Further, GUI was made (on Visual Basic) that required authentication to access the data.
